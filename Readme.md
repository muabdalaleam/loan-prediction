<h3><strong>Liscence:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>This is an <em>open scource</em> project so you can copy what<br>
do you want but you should at least understand the<br>
code you have copied.<br><br>
<li>You don't have permission to say this is your project.</ul>

<h3><strong>Project describtion:</strong></h3>
This is classification, wragling and EDA project we will<br>
try to create a very strong classification model that can<br>
detect will your loan request be accepted or not.<br><br>
And we will try to take important conlusions from the data<br>
using the plots and statistecs in the EDA section.<br>

<h3><strong>Project Limitations:</strong></h3><ul>
  <li><strong>Experince limitations</strong>:
  Because this is my first project<br>
  so I couldn't make more complex models or plots<br>
  like 3D plots or plotly plots but I will make in<br>
  the next project.<br><br>
  <li><strong>Personal limitations</strong>:
  I am now in my exams week so I<br> 
  couldn't complete this project in a short time.<br><br></ul>
