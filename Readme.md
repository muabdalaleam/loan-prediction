# Loan Prediction Project

Hey ☺️, Welcome to my Loan prediction project using ML & EDA but it’s **not reliable in real world** because it uses mock data anyway in this project we will walk through:

- Analyzing the data to get useful insights about our mock company 🧑🏻‍💼
- Cleaning & Learning things about preprocessing & ML 🧑🏻‍🏫
- Creating ML app to predict the acceptance of a Loan so our company mock customers can use it🧑🏻‍💻

**please **DON’T**  use this project for a real loan*
